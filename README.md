Co-occurrence Word Embeddings Project üìä
This project implements a basic framework for generating and visualizing co-occurrence word embeddings from a given text corpus. It covers the fundamental steps from extracting distinct words to plotting 2D embeddings after dimensionality reduction.

Project Overview
Word embeddings are a powerful tool in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that represent words as dense vectors of real numbers. These vectors capture semantic relationships between words based on their context. This script specifically focuses on count-based co-occurrence vectors, where the context is defined by words appearing within a certain window around a target word.

The project demonstrates:

Extracting unique words from a corpus.

Constructing a co-occurrence matrix.

Reducing the dimensionality of these vectors using PCA.

Visualizing the resulting 2D word embeddings.

How to Run the Script ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
Save the code: Copy the Python code from the co_occurrence_embeddings immersive artifact and save it as a .py file (e.g., co_occurrence_analysis.py).

Dependencies: Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

Execute: Run the script from your terminal:

python co_occurrence_analysis.py

The script will print various outputs to the console (distinct words, co-occurrence matrix, embedding shapes) and display a 2D plot of the word embeddings.

Corpus Dataset üìö
The script uses a hardcoded, diverse corpus directly within the if __name__ == "__main__": block. This corpus contains a variety of sentences designed to illustrate word relationships without being overly clustered.

Example snippets from the corpus include:

"The sun shines brightly in the clear blue sky."

"Cats are playful pets, but dogs are loyal companions."

"Computers process information quickly, enabling new technologies."

Implementation Details üõ†Ô∏è
The project is structured into several methods, each addressing a specific part of the word embedding pipeline:

b. get_distinct_words(corpus)
This method identifies and returns a sorted list of all unique words (word types) found in the provided corpus. It performs basic text cleaning by converting text to lowercase and removing punctuation.

c. construct_co_occurrence_matrix(corpus, window_size=4)
This function builds the co-occurrence matrix. For each word in the corpus, it considers words within a specified window_size before and after it. The matrix counts how many times each pair of words co-occurs within these windows. By default, the window size is 4, meaning it considers 4 words before and 4 words after the center word. In the main execution, it's demonstrated with a window_size of 3.

d. perform_dimensionality_reduction(matrix, k_dimensions=2)
This method takes the high-dimensional co-occurrence matrix and applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce its dimensionality. The k_dimensions parameter specifies the target number of dimensions for the embeddings (e.g., 2 for visualization). PCA helps to capture the most significant variance in the data, effectively compressing the information.

a. & e. plot_vectors_2d(vectors, word_labels, title="2D Word Embeddings")
This function is responsible for plotting the 2D word embeddings in a 2D space. It uses matplotlib to create a scatter plot where each point represents a word, labeled by its actual text. This visualization helps to observe semantic relationships; words that are frequently used in similar contexts tend to appear closer together in the plot.

Libraries Used üì¶
numpy: For numerical operations, especially matrix and vector manipulations.

collections: Specifically defaultdict for efficient counting.

matplotlib: For plotting the 2D word embeddings.

scikit-learn: For PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to perform dimensionality reduction.

re: For regular expression-based text cleaning (word extraction).

Future Enhancements üöÄ
More advanced text preprocessing: Add stemming, lemmatization, and stop-word removal.

Larger corpus integration: Allow reading from larger text files or external datasets.

Different dimensionality reduction techniques: Experiment with t-SNE for visualization.

Evaluation metrics: Implement ways to evaluate the quality of the embeddings (e.g., word analogy tasks).

Visualization interactivity: Use libraries like Plotly or Bokeh for interactive plots.
